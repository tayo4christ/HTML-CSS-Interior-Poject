# HTML-CSS-Interior-Poject
I was able to use the HTML and CSS to create a simple landing page using different tags in HTML/CSS. 
The simple landing page have 5 menus. 
The tags used include Hover tag, div tag, P tag, br tag, span tag, button tag, ul tag etc

How it started and how it ended. HTML and CSS single page project. Had to do a screenshot of all the days i worked on the project. And had to put all together in a frame. Putting my video editing skills to work. In case you are wondering, i used Wondershare filmora X software. Its actually a video editing software to capture all the daysðŸ‘Œ
